# Rothko Abstract Painting

### Description
This project recreates the essence of a Rothko-style abstract painting using pure HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates how CSS properties like `filter`, `box-shadow`, and `transform` can be used creatively to emulate the abstract texture and depth often seen in physical artworks. The main purpose for building this panting was to practice with what i know so far of HTML and CSS.

### Features
- **Canvas and Frame**: A bordered frame to represent a canvas display.
- **CSS Art**: No JavaScript or imagesâ€”pure CSS styling to mimic abstract art.
- **Blur and Shadows**: Effective use of `filter` and `box-shadow` to add subtle depth and glow.

### How to View
To see the painting in action, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: To structure the painting elements.
- **CSS3**: For styling, blurring, and shadow effects.
