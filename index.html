
<!------------------------------------------
- Mark Rothko was an American painter.
- He was best known for his contributions
- to abstract expressionism, particularly his iconic
- "color field" paintings.

- Born in 1903 in Latvia and emigrating to the U.S.,
- Rothko's art evolved from surrealist and figurative works to large,
- abstract compositions featuring rectangular blocks of color.

- His works are displayed in major museums around the world,
- and
- he remains a pivotal figure in 20th-century art.

- I completed this project on freeCodeCamp.
- It's just for practice purposes.
